# Enhancing Job Screening with AI and Data Intelligence

> AI-powered resume optimizer that tailors resumes to specific job descriptions, boosts ATS scores, and keeps profiles updated automatically.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The job application process is often inefficient and frustrating for candidates. Generic resumes rarely align with specific job postings, leading to poor visibility in Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and reduced interview chances.

This project uses **Agentic AI** and data intelligence to generate **ATS-optimized resumes**, matched precisely to the job description provided. It helps job seekers maximize their chances of success by:

- Aligning resumes to specific job requirements.
- Providing improvement suggestions and ATS scores.
- Outputting a JSON-based resume for future integration.
- Planning automated resume updates as users gain new skills/projects.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

- Job seekers use one-size-fits-all resumes that don't match unique job descriptions.
- Low alignment results in poor ATS ranking.
- Manually tailoring resumes is time-consuming and inconsistent.
- Users struggle to update resumes with latest skills, certifications, and achievements.

---

## ✅ Solution

An **AI-driven platform** that:
- Accepts user details and job description as input.
- Analyzes job description for keywords and role expectations.
- Matches user experience, projects, and skills to generate a custom resume.
- Calculates an **ATS score** and gives **suggested improvements**.
- Outputs a structured **JSON resume** format.
- Lays the foundation for **automated resume updates** in future releases.

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 **AI-generated, role-specific resumes**
- 📊 **ATS Score + Optimization Suggestions**
- 🧾 **Export to JSON format** for integrations and custom styling
